# Quark: Make Modded Wood More Useful (aka UselessWood)
Quark is a great mod, but it disables the default crafting recipes for things like ladders and chests. 
This can quickly become a problem if you find yourself in a pinch and all you have around you is modded wood.
 This datapack fixes that problem in the best way possible... ~~lazily~~...

This datapack adds chest and ladder recipes for modded wood types that craft into the default vanilla ladder and chest (no fancy custom-textured modded ladders and chests here...)Â 

A list of currently supported mods: (you do not need to have all of these mods installed in order for the datapack to work)
- [Biomes O' Plenty](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/biomes-o-plenty)
- [Alex's Caves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-caves)
- [Sky Lands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sky-lands)
- [Forbidden and Arcanus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forbidden-arcanus)
- [Ars Nouveau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-nouveau)
- [Ecologics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ecologics)

Do you know of a mod that also suffers from this problem? Feel free to open an issue and suggest it!
